# üìö TIU-UCA-T202	Object Oriented Programming with Java

Welcome to the TIU-BCA-2nd-Year-OOPwithJava repository! This repository contains all the assignments and class programs implemented in Java for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. This course is part of the third semester in the second year of the BCA (Hons.) Course at Techno India University.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple folders, each representing different aspects of the course:

- **Assignment-01**: Contains solutions to the 11 questions from the first assignment. Each Java source code file is named serially according to the question number.
- **Class-Programs**: Includes all the programs taught during class sessions. These programs cover various OOP concepts and are organized according to the topics covered in the syllabus.

More assignments will be added as separate folders in the same structure, ensuring easy access and navigation.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use the Source Code

To run the Java programs, you need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can use any JDK version that supports Java 8 or later.

### Installing JDK on Various Operating Systems:

#### Windows:

- Download the JDK from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the JDK
- Add the JDK's `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable
- Open a command prompt and type `java -version` to verify that the JDK is installed

#### Linux:

- On most Linux distributions, you can install OpenJDK using your package manager
- For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, use `sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk`
- On Fedora or Red Hat-based systems, use `sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel`
- Open a terminal and type `java -version` to verify that the JDK is installed

#### Mac:

- You can install the JDK using Homebrew by running `brew install openjdk`
- Alternatively, download and install the JDK from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- Open a terminal and type `java -version` to verify that the JDK is installed

### Compiling and Running Java Programs:

To compile a Java program, use the following command:

```bash
javac InputFile.java
```

Where `InputFile.java` is the name of the Java source code file that contains your program.

To run the compiled program, use the following command:

```bash
java InputFile
```

Where `InputFile` is the name of the compiled class file.
